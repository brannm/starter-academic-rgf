abstract: "We develop and apply new tools to understand Nb surface
chemistry and fundamental electronic processes using theoretical ab initio methods. We study the thermodynamics of
impurities and hydrides in the near-surface region as well as
their effect on the surface band gap. This makes it possible
for experimentalists to relate changes in STM dI/dV measurements resulting from different preparations to changes in
subsurface structure. We also calculate matrix elements for
electron-impurity scattering in Nb for common impurities
O, N, C, and H. By transforming these matrix elements into
a Wannier function basis, we calculate lifetimes for a dense
set of states on the Fermi surface and determine the mean
free path as a function of impurity density. This technique
can be generalized to calculate other scattering amplitudes
and timescales relevant to SRF theory."
