abstract: "The uptake and chemical speciation of oxygen in and on Ag(111) surface is described. An Ag(111) surface was exposed to gas-phase oxygen atoms under ultrahigh vacuum compatible conditions at various surface temperatures. The O uptake was quantified using temperature-programmed desorption measurements and showed that oxygen exposures at temperatures above 500 K yielded only surface-adsorbed oxygen in a single surface reconstruction. At temperatures below 500 K, O uptake continued past O surface saturation, and a maximum in the uptake with respect to exposure temperature was observed at 450 K. A model where O atoms must diffuse out of subsurface absorption sites to free room for further O describes this observation. The chemical speciation of the oxygenaceous species formed under these conditions was achieved using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These data show that a single O species initially formed on the surface, but at higher coverages, a new, three-dimensional oxygenaceous phase developed. Because of the importance of silver in heterogeneously catalyzed partial oxidation reactions, these results show that oxygen species embedded below the surface plane must be incorporated into accurate models of Ag-surface catalyzed reactions."
